# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
- I can see it being used to filter or check data

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
- Remember to put 'end' at the end of my if statements

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
- The Spicy challenge working after a couple of test rounds was very satisfying. I felt really good when I learned something new and applied previous knowledge that lead to a solution to something that is consider difficult for my current level.
